      Keya had a short list of contacts they trusted enough to ask favours from.  Most lived on the dark edges of supply chains and gossip networks.  One of them was known only as Retroactive65.  They were a rumoured legend in old hacker circles—a ghost who could pull keys out of cold wallets and spin identities from the lint of recycled MAC addresses.  No one ever admitted to meeting them.  They existed as a relay address on Lamina1 and a whisper in the archive.

When the fragments in echo_pool//active reached twenty‑seven, Keya triggered an old protocol: they sent a signed, encrypted ping to a lockb0x on the Lamina1 chain.  The message contained nothing more than a flag and a pair of parameters: “Need burner.  Low index.  For blue.  Quiet.”

The reply came three hours later in the form of a Pakana WorkOrder.

Pakana wasn’t a single app, but a network of smart contracts and micro‑services that ran on Lamina1 and bridged into other chains.  It had started as a barter exchange for modders and AI trainers—code for code, models for datasets.  Over time it evolved into a fully fledged peer‑to‑peer market where you could trade compute cycles for protein powder, or trade an old avatar mesh for decommissioned DePin sensors.  In The Blue, it doubled as a blackboard where you could post jobs, quests, or requests with the option to remain anonymous.  The only fee was gas.

Retroactive65’s WorkOrder contained a simple link to an escrow contract and a description: “Burner Identity Kit.  Includes generic avatar, untraceable handle, temporary wallet.  Delivery via The Blue.  Accept to claim.”

Keya accepted.  Their client dropped the contract’s gas from a small stash of L1 they kept for emergencies.  Seconds later, a file appeared in their inbox: a compressed package with an avatar template and authentication tokens.

In metaverse parlance, a generic avatar was as plain as possible.  It had no custom textures, no signature walk cycles, no unique facial topology.  Its proportions were deliberately average.  Its gait was tuned to blend into crowds.  It carried none of the biometric markers that premium avatars had—no embedded gait signatures, no retina‑scanning idiosyncrasies that persistent worlds could track.  Generic avatars were for people who wanted to be nobody.

Esoteric avatars were the opposite.  Custom rigged and meticulously skinned, they were status symbols in The Blue—wolf‑eared catgirls with glowing tattoos, mech suits infused with physics engines, avatars based on extinct animals or mythological beings.  They were expensive and traceable.  They advertised your wealth and taste.  They identified you as someone worth noticing.

Keya had no interest in being noticed.  The WorkOrder’s bundle unpacked into a simple, androgynous model with neutral skin tone and unmarked clothing.  The handle attached to it was a hash of a hash that would last only until their session ended.  It fit like a blank mask, and that was perfect.

Keya synced the avatar file into their interface.  Tiny pulses of electricity tickled their scalp as their neuro‑adaptation implants mapped the new body schema.  The implants were one of the few augmentations they openly embraced.  They allowed their nervous system to treat digital environments like physical space.  When their hand brushed a wall in The Blue, their real muscles tightened.  When they glanced over a virtual shoulder, their actual neck followed.  It made the experience immersive and potentially dangerous.  The pain felt in‑world could cause an adrenaline spike in‑body.  It also meant Keya could move through virtual spaces with the same intuition they had in analog ones.

They closed their eyes and connected.  The world blurred.  The hum of the Substrate swelled, then dampened, replaced by a softer throb.  Colours inverted, edges softened.  Sensation flickered on their tongue like ozone.

Keya opened their eyes in The Blue.

They were standing at the edge of nothing.
